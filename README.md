# Numbers-To-Words Challenge

This project is a command-line tool that takes an integer from **0** to **100,000** and converts it into English words.

## Example

```
Input: 12345
Output: twelve thousand, three hundred and forty-five
```

## About the Challenge

The goal is to write a CLI program that:

- Accepts an integer from standard input
- Outputs the number as English words (as shown in the example)
- Rejects numbers outside the allowed range (0â€“100,000)
- Uses only standard input/output (no GUI)

## Timeframe

- **Started:** 14th June 2025
- **Status:** Completed
- **Duration:** 1 day
